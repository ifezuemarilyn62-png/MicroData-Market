# MicroData Market  
A lightweight concept marketplace for micro-data — small datasets like images, notes, mini-surveys, and patterns — created for the Walrus Haulout Hackathon.

---

## 📌 Overview  
MicroData Market is a simple, community-powered platform where users can upload micro-data and earn small tokens whenever others download it.  
It focuses on *tiny* data items that are easy for anyone to contribute — no technical skills required.

The marketplace displays this micro-data in clean, organized grids, allowing users to explore and download items instantly.
